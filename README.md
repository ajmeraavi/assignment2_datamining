This is a walk through of the process I took while working with Crop Recommendation Dataset using JabBio

In the modern era, where data-driven decision-making is key, farmers can harness the power of machine learning to optimize crop selection and increase agricultural productivity. 

Predicting suitable crops for a farmer is a pivotal aspect of precision agriculture. In this article, I will take you through my journey of addressing this challenge using JadBio.

This is the landing page when I created a new project it asked for a project title and a brief project description

After the project is created, a dataset must be uploaded on the project page.

Once the dataset is uploaded, the dataset description shows up on the bottom of the page

File layout page allowed me to specify better data providing various features to include sample names, transpose data etc.

The Assign feature types page provides a deeper look into the dataset and gives the capability to filter data and switch to different feature types

This is the Analyze Data page where the dataset on which the analysis is to be performed was selected
